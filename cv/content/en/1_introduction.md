## My work

I am a software engineer: from user needs, I create reliable and scalable software solutions.

I strive to fully understand the needs of my users to find the most effective solutions. I take care of the interfaces and documentation of my applications to make them attractive and accessible.

I intervene on all aspects of the software: from the server infrastructure to the user experience. I create platforms with technologies adapted to the problems and constraints of the projects.

I seek maximum quality and productivity. I implement tools to allow developers to focus on adding value to products (continuous integration,
static code analyses, debug tools, development aids, etc.).

If necessary, I support my team members' skills development using good development practices and group work sessions (pair coding and more).

These days I work with these technologies:

- Server infrastructure: Google Cloud Platform, Amazon Web Services, Kubernetes, Docker, Ansible, GNU/Linux, ...
- Databases: PostgreSQL, MySQL/MariaDB, MongoDB, Elasticsearch, SQLite ...
- Languages: Javascript, Typescript, Java
- Interfaces: React, Redux, Bootstrap, CSS, SASS, HTML5, Electron.js, React Native...

My last evening project is online, try it: [https://abc-map.fr](https://abc-map.fr). This is a little glimpse of what I can do.
